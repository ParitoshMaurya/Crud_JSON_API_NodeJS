# Crud JSON API NodeJS
In this project, I have written API for all crud operations with JSON in NodeJS (Backend Only). We can send request by Postman or any rest api client. This will save and fetch user data from user.json. I have used express to build all APIs for crud operations.

## Requirements
If you're using Linux-based OS, install the latest version of Nodejs and npm, by typing the following commands on your terminal.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential apt-transport-https lsb-release ca-certificates curl
```
Then, for the Latest release (version 13), add this PPA, by typing the following command on your terminal
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_13.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install nodejs
```
Then type `npm install` to install all node modules. You can start server by typing `npm start`
